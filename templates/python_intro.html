    <h1>An Informal Introduction to Python</h1>
    <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p>

    <p>You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on >>> in the upper-right corner of an example box. If you hide the prompts and output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the input lines into your interpreter.</p>

    <p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.</p>

    <h2>Using Python as a Calculator</h2>
    <p>Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)</p>

    <h3>Numbers</h3>
    <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, *, and / can be used to perform arithmetic; parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>2 + 2
        4

        50 - 5*6
        20

        (50 - 5*6) / 4
        5.0

        8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
        1.6</code>
    </pre>

    <p>The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.</p>

    <h2>Python Arithmetic Operators</h2>
    <p>Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:</p>
    <pre>
        17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
        5.666666666666667
        <br>
        17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
        5
        <br>
        17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
        2
        <br>
        5 * 3 + 2  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder
        17
    </pre>
    <p>With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers:</p>
    <pre>
        5 ** 2  # 5 squared
        25
        <br>
        2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
        128
    </pre>
    <h2>Assigning Values to Variables</h2>
    <p>The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:</p>
    <pre>
        width = 20
        <br>
        height = 5 * 9
        <br>
        width * height
        900
    </pre>
    <p>If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:</p>
    <pre>
        n  <!-- try to access an undefined variable -->
        <!-- Output: NameError: name 'n' is not defined -->
    </pre>
    <p>There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to floating point:</p>
    <pre>
        4 * 3.75 - 1
        14.0
    </pre>
    <h2>Interactive Mode</h2>
    <p>In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _. This means that when you are using Python as a desk calculator, it is somewhat easier to continue calculations:</p>
    <pre>
        tax = 12.5 / 100
        <br>
        price = 100.50
        <br>
        price * tax
        12.5625
        <br>
        price + _
        113.0625
        <br>
        round(_, 2)
        113.06
    </pre>
    <p>This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would create an independent local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.</p>
    <h2>Other Numeric Types</h2>
    <p>In addition to int and float, Python supports other types of numbers, such as Decimal and Fraction. Python also has built-in support for complex numbers, and uses the j or J suffix to indicate the imaginary part (e.g. 3+5j).</p>

    <h2>Text Manipulation in Python</h2>
    <p>Python can manipulate text (represented by type <code>str</code>, so-called “strings”) as well as numbers. This includes characters “!”, words “rabbit”, names “Paris”, sentences “Got your back.”, etc. “Yay! :)”. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'spam eggs'  <!-- single quotes -->
    'spam eggs'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; "Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!"  <!-- double quotes -->
    'Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; '1975'  <!-- digits and numerals enclosed in quotes are also strings -->
    '1975'
    </pre>
    <p>To quote a quote, we need to “escape” it, by preceding it with \. Alternatively, we can use the other type of quotation marks:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'doesn\'t'  <!-- use \' to escape the single quote... -->
    "doesn't"

    &gt;&gt;&gt; "doesn't"  <!-- ...or use double quotes instead -->
    "doesn't"

    &gt;&gt;&gt; '"Yes," they said.'
    '"Yes," they said.'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; "\"Yes,\" they said."
    '"Yes," they said.'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; '"Isn\'t," they said.'
    '"Isn\'t," they said.'
    </pre>
    <p>In the Python shell, the string definition and output string can look different. The <code>print()</code> function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  <!-- \n means newline -->

    &gt;&gt;&gt; s  <!-- without print(), special characters are included in the string -->
    'First line.\nSecond line.'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(s)  <!-- with print(), special characters are interpreted, so \n produces a new line -->
    First line.
    Second line.
    </pre>
    <p>If you don’t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an <code>r</code> before the first quote:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print('C:\some\name')  <!-- here \n means newline! -->
    C:\some
    ame

    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(r'C:\some\name')  <!-- note the r before the quote -->
    C:\some\name
    </pre>
    <p>There is one subtle aspect to raw strings: a raw string may not end in an odd number of \ characters; see the FAQ entry for more information and workarounds.</p>

    <h2>Working with Strings in Python</h2>
    <p>String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: <code>"""..."""</code> or <code>'''...'''</code>. End of lines are automatically included in the string, but it’s possible to prevent this by adding a <code>\</code> at the end of the line. The following example:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print("""\
    Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
         -h                        Display this usage message
         -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
    """)
    </pre>
    <p>produces the following output (note that the initial newline is not included):</p>
    <pre>
    Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
         -h                        Display this usage message
         -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
    </pre>
    <p>Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the <code>+</code> operator, and repeated with <code>*</code>:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
    3 * 'un' + 'ium'
    'unununium'
    </pre>
    <p>Two or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically concatenated:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Py' 'thon'
    'Python'
    </pre>
    <p>This feature is particularly useful when you want to break long strings:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; text = ('Put several strings within parentheses '
    ...
    ...         'to have them joined together.')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; text
    'Put several strings within parentheses to have them joined together.'
    </pre>
    <p>This only works with two literals though, not with variables or expressions:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; prefix = 'Py'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; prefix 'thon'  # can't concatenate a variable and a string literal
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
        prefix 'thon'
               ^^^^^^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ('un' * 3) 'ium'
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
        ('un' * 3) 'ium'
                   ^^^^^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    </pre>
    <p>If you want to concatenate variables or a variable and a literal, use <code>+</code>:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; prefix + 'thon'
    'Python'
    </pre>
    <p>Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word = 'Python'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[0]  # character in position 0
    'P'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[5]  # character in position 5
    'n'
    </pre>
    <p>Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[-1]  # last character
    'n'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[-2]  # second-last character
    'o'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[-6]
    'P'
    </pre>
    <p>Note that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1.</p>

    <h2>String Slicing in Python</h2>
    <p>In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain substrings:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
    'Py'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
    'tho'
    </pre>
    <p>Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)
    'Py'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
    'on'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end
    'on'
    </pre>
    <p>Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that <code>s[:i] + s[i:]</code> is always equal to <code>s</code>:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[:2] + word[2:]
    'Python'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[:4] + word[4:]
    'Python'
    </pre>
    <p>One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n, for example:</p>
    <pre>
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | P | y | t | h | o | n |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
    </pre>
    <p>The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0…6 in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. The slice from i to j consists of all characters between the edges labeled i and j, respectively.</p>
    <p>For non-negative indices, the length of a slice is the difference of the indices, if both are within bounds. For example, the length of <code>word[1:3]</code> is 2.</p>
    <p>Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[42]  # the word only has 6 characters
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    IndexError: string index out of range
    </pre>
    <p>However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[4:42]
    'on'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[42:]
    ''
    </pre>
    <p>Python strings cannot be changed — they are immutable. Therefore, assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[0] = 'J'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[2:] = 'py'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
    </pre>
    <p>If you need a different string, you should create a new one:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'J' + word[1:]
    'Jython'

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[:2] + 'py'
    'Pypy'
    </pre>
    <p>The built-in function <code>len()</code> returns the length of a string:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(s)
    34
    </pre>
