    <h2>More Control Flow Tools</h2>
    <p>As well as the while statement just introduced, Python uses a few more that we will encounter in this chapter.</p>
    <h3>4.1. if Statements</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
    Please enter an integer: 42

    if x < 0:

        x = 0

        print('Negative changed to zero')

    elif x == 0:

        print('Zero')

    elif x == 1:

        print('Single')

    else:

        print('More')
    </pre>
    <p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’ and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.</p>
    <p>If you’re comparing the same value to several constants or checking for specific types or attributes, you may also find the match statement useful. For more details see match Statements.</p>
    <h3>4.2. for Statements</h3>
    <p>The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal) or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as in C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Measure some strings:
    ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
    ...
    ... for w in words:
    ...     print(w, len(w))
    cat 3
    window 6
    defenestrate 12
    </pre>
    <p>Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straightforward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:</p>
    <pre>
    # Create a sample collection
    users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Éléonore': 'inactive', '景太郎': 'active'}

    # Strategy: Iterate over a copy
    for user, status in users.copy().items():
        if status == 'inactive':
            del users[user]

    # Strategy: Create a new collection
    active_users = {}
    for user, status in users.items():
        if status == 'active':
            active_users[user] = status
    </pre>
    <h3>4.3. The range() Function</h3>
    <p>If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):
    ...     print(i)
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    </pre>
    <p>The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(range(5, 10))
    [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(range(0, 10, 3))
    [0, 3, 6, 9]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(range(-10, -100, -30))
    [-10, -40, -70]
    </pre>
    <p>To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and len() as follows:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
    ...
    ... for i in range(len(a)):
    ...     print(i, a[i])
    0 Mary
    1 had
    2 a
    3 little
    4 lamb
    </pre>
    <p>In most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the enumerate() function, see Looping Techniques.</p>
    <p>A strange thing happens if you just print a range:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; range(10)
    range(0, 10)
    </pre>
    <p>In many ways, the object returned by range() behaves as if it is a list, but in fact, it isn’t. It is an object that returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn’t really make the list, thus saving space.</p>
    <p>We say such an object is iterable, that is, suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect something from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. We have seen that the for statement is such a construct, while an example of a function that takes an iterable is sum():</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sum(range(4))  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3
    6
    </pre>
    <p>Later we will see more functions that return iterables and take iterables as arguments. In chapter Data Structures, we will discuss in more detail about list().</p>
    <h3>4.4. break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops</h3>
    <p>The break statement breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.</p>
    <p>A for or while loop can include an else clause.</p>
    <p>In a for loop, the else clause is executed after the loop reaches its final iteration.</p>
    <p>In a while loop, it’s executed after the loop’s condition becomes false.</p>
    <p>In either kind of loop, the else clause is not executed if the loop was terminated by a break.</p>
    <p>This is exemplified in the following for loop, which searches for prime numbers:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for n in range(2, 10):
    ...     for x in range(2, n):
    ...         if n % x == 0:
    ...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
    ...             break
    ...     else:
    ...         # loop fell through without finding a factor
    ...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
    2 is a prime number
    3 is a prime number
    4 equals 2 * 2
    5 is a prime number
    6 equals 2 * 3
    7 is a prime number
    8 equals 2 * 4
    9 equals 3 * 3
    </pre>
    <p>(Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the else clause belongs to the for loop, not the if statement.)</p>
    <p>When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement than it does with that of if statements: a try statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs. For more on the try statement and exceptions, see Handling Exceptions.</p>
    <p>The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for num in range(2, 10):
    ...     if num % 2 == 0:
    ...         print("Found an even number", num)
    ...         continue
    ...     print("Found an odd number", num)
    Found an even number 2
    Found an odd number 3
    Found an even number 4
    Found an odd number 5
    Found an even number 6
    Found an odd number 7
    Found an even number 8
    Found an odd number 9
    </pre>
    <h3>4.5. pass Statements</h3>
    <p>The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. For example:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; while True:
    ...     pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
    </pre>
    <p>This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; class MyEmptyClass:
    ...     pass
    </pre>
    <p>Another place pass can be used is as a placeholder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:</p>
    <pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def initlog(*args):
    ...     pass   # Remember to implement this!
    </pre>

    <h2>Match Statements</h2>

    <p>A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. This is superficially similar to a switch statement in C, Java, or JavaScript (and many other languages), but it’s more similar to pattern matching in languages like Rust or Haskell. Only the first pattern that matches gets executed and it can also extract components (sequence elements or object attributes) from the value into variables.</p>

    <p>The simplest form compares a subject value against one or more literals:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    def http_error(status):
        match status:
            case 400:
                return "Bad request"
            case 404:
                return "Not found"
            case 418:
                return "I'm a teapot"
            case _:
                return "Something's wrong with the internet"
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Note the last block: the “variable name” _ acts as a wildcard and never fails to match. If no case matches, none of the branches is executed.</p>

    <p>You can combine several literals in a single pattern using | (“or”):</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    case 401 | 403 | 404:
        return "Not allowed"
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Patterns can look like unpacking assignments, and can be used to bind variables:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    # point is an (x, y) tuple
    match point:
        case (0, 0):
            print("Origin")
        case (0, y):
            print(f"Y={y}")
        case (x, 0):
            print(f"X={x}")
        case (x, y):
            print(f"X={x}, Y={y}")
        case _:
            raise ValueError("Not a point")
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Study that one carefully! The first pattern has two literals, and can be thought of as an extension of the literal pattern shown above. But the next two patterns combine a literal and a variable, and the variable binds a value from the subject (point). The fourth pattern captures two values, which makes it conceptually similar to the unpacking assignment (x, y) = point.</p>

    <p>If you are using classes to structure your data you can use the class name followed by an argument list resembling a constructor, but with the ability to capture attributes into variables:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    class Point:
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

    def where_is(point):
        match point:
            case Point(x=0, y=0):
                print("Origin")
            case Point(x=0, y=y):
                print(f"Y={y}")
            case Point(x=x, y=0):
                print(f"X={x}")
            case Point():
                print("Somewhere else")
            case _:
                print("Not a point")
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>You can use positional parameters with some builtin classes that provide an ordering for their attributes (e.g. dataclasses). You can also define a specific position for attributes in patterns by setting the __match_args__ special attribute in your classes. If it’s set to (“x”, “y”), the following patterns are all equivalent (and all bind the y attribute to the var variable):</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    Point(1, var)
    Point(1, y=var)
    Point(x=1, y=var)
    Point(y=var, x=1)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>A recommended way to read patterns is to look at them as an extended form of what you would put on the left of an assignment, to understand which variables would be set to what. Only the standalone names (like var above) are assigned to by a match statement. Dotted names (like foo.bar), attribute names (the x= and y= above) or class names (recognized by the “(…)” next to them like Point above) are never assigned to.</p>

    <p>Patterns can be arbitrarily nested. For example, if we have a short list of Points, with __match_args__ added, we could match it like this:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    class Point:
        __match_args__ = ('x', 'y')
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

    match points:
        case []:
            print("No points")
        case [Point(0, 0)]:
            print("The origin")
        case [Point(x, y)]:
            print(f"Single point {x}, {y}")
        case [Point(0, y1), Point(0, y2)]:
            print(f"Two on the Y axis at {y1}, {y2}")
        case _:
            print("Something else")
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We can add an if clause to a pattern, known as a “guard”. If the guard is false, match goes on to try the next case block. Note that value capture happens before the guard is evaluated:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    match point:
        case Point(x, y) if x == y:
            print(f"Y=X at {x}")
        case Point(x, y):
            print(f"Not on the diagonal")
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Several other key features of this statement:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Like unpacking assignments, tuple and list patterns have exactly the same meaning and actually match arbitrary sequences. An important exception is that they don’t match iterators or strings.</li>
        <li>Sequence patterns support extended unpacking: [x, y, *rest] and (x, y, *rest) work similar to unpacking assignments. The name after * may also be _, so (x, y, *_) matches a sequence of at least two items without binding the remaining items.</li>
        <li>Mapping patterns: {"bandwidth": b, "latency": l} captures the "bandwidth" and "latency" values from a dictionary. Unlike sequence patterns, extra keys are ignored. An unpacking like **rest is also supported. (But **_ would be redundant, so it is not allowed.)</li>
        <li>Subpatterns may be captured using the as keyword:</li>
        <pre>
        <code>
        case (Point(x1, y1), Point(x2, y2) as p2): ...
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>will capture the second element of the input as p2 (as long as the input is a sequence of two points)</p>
        <li>Most literals are compared by equality, however the singletons True, False and None are compared by identity.</li>
        <li>Patterns may use named constants. These must be dotted names to prevent them from being interpreted as capture variable:</li>
        <pre>
        <code>
        from enum import Enum
        class Color(Enum):
            RED = 'red'
            GREEN = 'green'
            BLUE = 'blue'

        color = Color(input("Enter your choice of 'red', 'blue' or 'green': "))

        match color:
            case Color.RED:
                print("I see red!")
            case Color.GREEN:
                print("Grass is green")
            case Color.BLUE:
                print("I'm feeling the blues :(")
        </code>
        </pre>
    </ul>

    <p>For a more detailed explanation and additional examples, you can look into <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/">PEP 636</a> which is written in a tutorial format.</p>

    <h2>Defining Functions</h2>

    <p>We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n

        """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""

        a, b = 0, 1

        while a < n:

            print(a, end=' ')

            a, b = b, a+b

        print()
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The keyword <code>def</code> introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.</p>

    <p>The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s documentation string, or docstring. There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.</p>

    <p>The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for global variables, named in a <code>global</code> statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions, named in a <code>nonlocal</code> statement), although they may be referenced.</p>

    <p>The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object). When a function calls another function, or calls itself recursively, a new local symbol table is created for that call.</p>

    <p>A function definition associates the function name with the function object in the current symbol table. The interpreter recognizes the object pointed to by that name as a user-defined function. Other names can also point to that same function object and can also be used to access the function:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    fib
    &lt;function fib at 10042ed0&gt;

    f = fib

    f(100)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Coming from other languages, you might object that <code>fib</code> is not a function but a procedure since it doesn’t return a value. In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called <code>None</code> (it’s a built-in name). Writing the value <code>None</code> is normally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using <code>print()</code>:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    fib(0)

    print(fib(0))
    None
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>It is simple to write a function that returns a list of the numbers of the Fibonacci series, instead of printing it:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    def fib2(n):  # return Fibonacci series up to n

        """Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n."""

        result = []

        a, b = 0, 1

        while a < n:

            result.append(a)    # see below

            a, b = b, a+b

        return result
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p><code>f100 = fib2(100)</code>    # call it</p>

    <p><code>f100</code>                # write the result</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This example, as usual, demonstrates some new Python features:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The <code>return</code> statement returns with a value from a function. <code>return</code> without an expression argument returns <code>None</code>. Falling off the end of a function also returns <code>None</code>.</li>
        <li>The statement <code>result.append(a)</code> calls a method of the list object <code>result</code>. A method is a function that ‘belongs’ to an object and is named <code>obj.methodname</code>, where <code>obj</code> is some object (this may be an expression), and <code>methodname</code> is the name of a method that is defined by the object’s type. Different types define different methods. Methods of different types may have the same name without causing ambiguity. (It is possible to define your own object types and methods, using classes, see Classes) The method <code>append()</code> shown in the example is defined for list objects; it adds a new element at the end of the list. In this example it is equivalent to <code>result = result + [a]</code>, but more efficient.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>More on Defining Functions</h3>

    <p>It is also possible to define functions with a variable number of arguments. There are three forms, which can be combined.</p>

    <h4>Default Argument Values</h4>

    <p>The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function that can be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to allow. For example:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    def ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):
        while True:
            ok = input(prompt)
            if ok in ('y', 'ye', 'yes'):
                return True
            if ok in ('n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'):
                return False
            retries = retries - 1
            if retries < 0:
                raise ValueError('invalid user response')
            print(reminder)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This function can be called in several ways:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Giving only the mandatory argument: <code>ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')</code></li>
        <li>Giving one of the optional arguments: <code>ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)</code></li>
        <li>Or even giving all arguments: <code>ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or no!')</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This example also introduces the <code>in</code> keyword. This tests whether or not a sequence contains a certain value.</p>

    <p>The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in the defining scope, so that</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    i = 5

    def f(arg=i):
        print(arg)

    i = 6
    f()
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>will print 5.</p>

    <p><strong>Important warning:</strong> The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For example, the following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    def f(a, L=[]):
        L.append(a)
        return L

    print(f(1))
    print(f(2))
    print(f(3))
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This will print</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    [1]
    [1, 2]
    [1, 2, 3]
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>If you don’t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    def f(a, L=None):
        if L is None:
            L = []
        L.append(a)
        return L
    </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Keyword Arguments</h2>

    <p>Functions can also be called using keyword arguments of the form kwarg=value. For instance, the following function:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> def parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom', type='Norwegian Blue'):
    ...     print("-- This parrot wouldn't", action, end=' ')
    ...     print("if you put", voltage, "volts through it.")
    ...     print("-- Lovely plumage, the", type)
    ...     print("-- It's", state, "!")
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>accepts one required argument (voltage) and three optional arguments (state, action, and type). This function can be called in any of the following ways:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> parrot(1000)                                          # 1 positional argument
    >>> parrot(voltage=1000)                                  # 1 keyword argument
    >>> parrot(voltage=1000000, action='VOOOOOM')             # 2 keyword arguments
    >>> parrot(action='VOOOOOM', voltage=1000000)             # 2 keyword arguments
    >>> parrot('a million', 'bereft of life', 'jump')         # 3 positional arguments
    >>> parrot('a thousand', state='pushing up the daisies')  # 1 positional, 1 keyword
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>but all the following calls would be invalid:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> parrot()                     # required argument missing
    >>> parrot(voltage=5.0, 'dead')  # non-keyword argument after a keyword argument
    >>> parrot(110, voltage=220)     # duplicate value for the same argument
    >>> parrot(actor='John Cleese')  # unknown keyword argument
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments. All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function (e.g. actor is not a valid argument for the parrot function), and their order is not important. This also includes non-optional arguments (e.g. parrot(voltage=1000) is valid too). No argument may receive a value more than once. Here’s an example that fails due to this restriction:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> def function(a):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> function(0, a=0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: function() got multiple values for argument 'a'
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>When a final formal parameter of the form **name is present, it receives a dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict) containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form *name (described in the next subsection) which receives a tuple containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. (*name must occur before **name.) For example, if we define a function like this:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> def cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords):
    ...     print("-- Do you have any", kind, "?")
    ...     print("-- I'm sorry, we're all out of", kind)
    ...     for arg in arguments:
    ...         print(arg)
    ...     print("-" * 40)
    ...     for kw in keywords:
    ...         print(kw, ":", keywords[kw])
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>It could be called like this:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> cheeseshop("Limburger", "It's very runny, sir.",
    ...            "It's really very, VERY runny, sir.",
    ...            shopkeeper="Michael Palin",
    ...            client="John Cleese",
    ...            sketch="Cheese Shop Sketch")
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>and of course it would print:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    -- Do you have any Limburger ?
    -- I'm sorry, we're all out of Limburger
    It's very runny, sir.
    It's really very, VERY runny, sir.
    ----------------------------------------
    shopkeeper : Michael Palin
    client : John Cleese
    sketch : Cheese Shop Sketch
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Note that the order in which the keyword arguments are printed is guaranteed to match the order in which they were provided in the function call.</p>

    <h3>Special parameters</h3>

    <p>By default, arguments may be passed to a Python function either by position or explicitly by keyword. For readability and performance, it makes sense to restrict the way arguments can be passed so that a developer need only look at the function definition to determine if items are passed by position, by position or keyword, or by keyword.</p>

    <p>A function definition may look like:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> def f(pos1, pos2, /, pos_or_kwd, *, kwd1, kwd2):
    ...       -----------    ----------     ----------
    ...         |             |                  |
    ...         |        Positional or keyword   |
    ...         |                                - Keyword only
    ...          -- Positional only
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>where / and * are optional. If used, these symbols indicate the kind of parameter by how the arguments may be passed to the function: positional-only, positional-or-keyword, and keyword-only. Keyword parameters are also referred to as named parameters.</p>

    <h4>Positional-or-Keyword Arguments</h4>

    <p>If / and * are not present in the function definition, arguments may be passed to a function by position or by keyword.</p>

    <h4>Positional-Only Parameters</h4>

    <p>Looking at this in a bit more detail, it is possible to mark certain parameters as positional-only. If positional-only, the parameters’ order matters, and the parameters cannot be passed by keyword. Positional-only parameters are placed before a / (forward-slash). The / is used to logically separate the positional-only parameters from the rest of the parameters. If there is no / in the function definition, there are no positional-only parameters.</p>

    <p>Parameters following the / may be positional-or-keyword or keyword-only.</p>

    <h4>Keyword-Only Arguments</h4>

    <p>To mark parameters as keyword-only, indicating the parameters must be passed by keyword argument, place an * in the arguments list just before the first keyword-only parameter.</p>

    <h4>Function Examples</h4>

    <p>Consider the following example function definitions paying close attention to the markers / and *:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> def standard_arg(arg):
    ...     print(arg)
    ...
    >>> def pos_only_arg(arg, /):
    ...     print(arg)
    ...
    >>> def kwd_only_arg(*, arg):
    ...     print(arg)
    ...
    >>> def combined_example(pos_only, /, standard, *, kwd_only):
    ...     print(pos_only, standard, kwd_only)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The first function definition, standard_arg, the most familiar form, places no restrictions on the calling convention and arguments may be passed by position or keyword:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> standard_arg(2)
    2

    >>> standard_arg(arg=2)
    2
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The second function pos_only_arg is restricted to only use positional parameters as there is a / in the function definition:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> pos_only_arg(1)
    1

    >>> pos_only_arg(arg=1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: pos_only_arg() got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: 'arg'
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The third function kwd_only_args only allows keyword arguments as indicated by a * in the function definition:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> kwd_only_arg(3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: kwd_only_arg() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given

    >>> kwd_only_arg(arg=3)
    3
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>And the last uses all three calling conventions in the same function definition:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> combined_example(1, 2, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: combined_example() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given

    >>> combined_example(1, 2, kwd_only=3)
    1 2 3

    >>> combined_example(1, standard=2, kwd_only=3)
    1 2 3

    >>> combined_example(pos_only=1, standard=2, kwd_only=3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: combined_example() got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: 'pos_only'
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Finally, consider this function definition which has a potential collision between the positional argument name and **kwds which has name as a key:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> def foo(name, **kwds):
    ...     return 'name' in kwds
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>There is no possible call that will make it return True as the keyword 'name' will always bind to the first parameter. For example:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> foo(1, **{'name': 2})
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: foo() got multiple values for argument 'name'
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>But using / (positional only arguments), it is possible since it allows name as a positional argument and 'name' as a key in the keyword arguments:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    >>> def foo(name, /, **kwds):
    ...     return 'name' in kwds
    ...
    >>> foo(1, **{'name': 2})
    True
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In other words, the names of positional-only parameters can be used in **kwds without ambiguity.</p>
