        <h1>Introduction to Statistics</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to this introduction to Statistics. Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing numerical data. It plays a crucial role in various fields such as economics, psychology, sociology, and more. In this video, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of Statistics to understand how data can be analyzed and interpreted.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 1: Statistics in Everyday Life -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Statistics in Everyday Life</h2>
        <p>
            Statistics is all around us, influencing decisions in our daily lives and shaping our understanding of the world. Whether it's analyzing survey results, predicting market trends, or evaluating risks, statistics provides valuable insights. For example, when we hear statements like "60% of people prefer product A over product B," or "the average temperature this month is 25 degrees Celsius," we are encountering statistical information that informs our decisions and actions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Data Classification -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Classification</h2>
        <p>
            Data can be classified into two main types: discrete and continuous. Discrete data consists of distinct values with no possible values in between. Examples include the number of students in a class or the number of cars in a parking lot. On the other hand, continuous data can take any value within a given range. Examples include temperature, weight, and height.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within these types, data can further be categorized as nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. Nominal data represents categories without any inherent order (e.g., colors, genders). Ordinal data has a natural order, but the differences between categories are not uniform (e.g., ratings such as "good," "better," "best"). Interval data has a consistent interval between values, but lacks a true zero point (e.g., temperature measured in Celsius). Ratio data has a true zero point and consistent intervals (e.g., height, weight).
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Measures of Central Tendency -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Measures of Central Tendency</h2>
        <p>
            Measures of central tendency describe the center or typical value of a dataset. They include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> Also known as the average, the mean is calculated by summing all values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. It is sensitive to outliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. It is less affected by outliers than the mean.</li>
            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. It can be used for both numerical and categorical data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These measures provide insight into the central tendency of a dataset, helping to understand its typical values.
        </p>

    <!-- Section 4: Measures of Dispersion -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Measures of Dispersion</h2>
        <p>
            Measures of dispersion quantify the spread or variability of data points within a dataset. They include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Range:</strong> The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides a simple measure of spread but is sensitive to outliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> The standard deviation measures the average distance of each data point from the mean of the dataset. It indicates how much the data deviates from the mean and is less sensitive to outliers compared to the range.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These measures complement measures of central tendency by providing additional information about the distribution of data points.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 5: Visual Representation of Data -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Visual Representation of Data</h2>
        <p>
            Visual representations of data, such as charts and graphs, are powerful tools for understanding complex datasets. Common types of visualizations include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Charts:</strong> Used to compare categories of data.</li>
            <li><strong>Line Charts:</strong> Show trends over time or relationships between variables.</li>
            <li><strong>Histograms:</strong> Display frequency distributions of continuous data.</li>
            <li><strong>Pie Charts:</strong> Represent parts of a whole, often used for percentages or proportions.</li>
            <li><strong>Scatter Plots:</strong> Show the relationship between two numerical variables, useful for identifying correlations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These visualizations help in identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, making it easier to interpret and communicate findings.

    <h1>Introduction to Inferential Statistics</h1>

    <!-- Section 1: Inferential Statistics -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Inferential Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            Inferential statistics involves making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. Rather than analyzing the entire population, statisticians use samples to draw conclusions about the population as a whole. This allows for more efficient and practical analysis.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Steps to Compute Inferential Statistics -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Steps to Compute Inferential Statistics</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a random sample drawn from the population.</li>
            <li>Compute a statistic.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Sampling Distribution -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Sampling Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            The probability distribution of a statistic (sample estimate) is called a sampling distribution. It depends on factors such as the distribution of the population, the size of the sample, and the method of sample selection.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4: Sampling Distribution of Mean -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Sampling Distribution of Mean</h2>
        <p>
            Suppose we draw all possible samples of size n from a given population and compute the mean of each sample. The probability distribution of these means is called a sampling distribution of the mean.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 5: Standard Error -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Standard Error</h2>
        <p>
            The standard error measures the variability of sample statistics around the population parameter. It is primarily determined by the standard deviation of the population and the sample size. The relationship between standard error (<span class="formula">σ<sub>x</sub></span>) and sample size (n) is inversely proportional, meaning that as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The standard error (<span class="formula">σ<sub>x</sub></span>) is calculated as:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
            <span class="formula">σ<sub>x</sub> = σ / √n</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            where σ is the standard deviation of the population and n is the sample size.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 6: Standard Error Examples -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Standard Error: Examples</h2>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of calculating standard error using R codes:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            For a small sample size of 10:
            <br>
            small_sample <- 15 / sqrt(10)
            <br>
            print(small_sample)
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            For a larger sample size of 1000:
            <br>
            large_sample <- 15 / sqrt(1000)
            <br>
            print(large_sample)
        </div>
        <p>
            Another example using R:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            library(psych)
            <br>
            describe(faithful$eruptions)
            <br>
            sd(faithful$eruptions) / sqrt(length(faithful$eruptions))
        </div>
    </div>
